## Project Requirements
    * You and your group will use everything you’ve learned over the past six modules to create a real-world front-end application that you’ll be able to showcase to potential employers. The user story and acceptance criteria will depend on the project that you create, but your project must fulfil the following requirements:
    * Use a CSS framework other than Bootstrap.
    * Be deployed to GitHub Pages.
    * Be interactive (i.e., accept and respond to user input).
    * Use at least two server-side APIs.
    * Does not use alerts, confirms, or prompts (use modals).
    * Use client-side storage to store persistent data.
    * Be responsive.
    * Have a polished UI.
    * Have a clean repository that meets quality coding standards (file structure, naming conventions, follows best practices for class/id naming conventions, indentation, quality comments, etc.).
    * Have a quality README (with unique name, description, technologies used, screenshot, and link to deployed application).
## User Story
    * As a movie watcher I want to see movie information directory
    * It would also let me know where to watch the movie I like
*
## Acceptance Criteria
    * It’s done when I select the movie on the sample selection box, or search from the search box the name of the movie, genre, year, or ratings of the movies.
    * When I select a movie from the database, it’ll display the synopsis, images, ratings, reviews, cast information.
    * It’ll also display where it can be watched (i.e. Netflix, Hulu, Disney+, or theaters nearby).
    * If it’s available in any theaters, the page will be redirected to view the movie schedules of the theaters nearby or any location the user want to select.
    * When selecting a schedule, a dropdown calendar can be used to change the dates.
    * A map API will be used to select and see the location of the theater.
    * Make a pull request, merging branches, and ask for a peer review on Github. Tec
